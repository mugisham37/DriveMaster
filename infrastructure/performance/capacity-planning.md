2. **Request Rate** (RPS by service)
3. **Error Rate** (4xx, 5xx errors)
4. **Resource Utilization** (CPU, Memory, Disk)
5. **Database Performance** (Query time, connections)
6. **Cache Performance** (Hit ratio, latency)
7. **Algorithm Performance** (Scoring time, accuracy)

#### Alert Thresholds

```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - Response time P95 > 500ms for 2 minutes
  - Error rate > 1% for 1 minute
  - Service availability < 99% for 5 minutes
  - Database connections > 90% for 2 minutes

Warning Alerts:
  - Response time P95 > 300ms for 5 minutes

  - Memory utilization > 85% for 10 minutes
  - Cache hit ratio < 80% for 10 minutes
```

### Performance Testing Schedule

#### Continuous Testing

- **Daily**: Smoke tests (100 users, 5 minutes)
- **Weekly**: Load tests (1,000 users, 30 minutes)
- **Monthly**: Stress tests (5,000+ users, 2 hours)
- **Quarterly**: Capacity tests (10,000+ users, 4 hours)

#### Test Scenarios

1. **Normal Usage Pattern**: 70% practice, 20% review, 10% mock tests
2. **Peak Usage Pattern**: Exam season simulation
3. **Spike Test**: Sudden traffic increase (5x normal)
4. **Soak Test**: Extended load over 24 hours
5. **Chaos Test**: Service failure simulation

### Conclusion

The Adaptive Learning Platform demonstrates strong performance under normal and peak loads, with some optimization needed for extreme stress scenarios. The recommended improvements will ensure the system can handle 10,000 concurrent users while maintaining sub-300ms response times and 99.9% availability.

Key success factors:

1. Proactive monitoring and alerting
2. Gradual scaling based on real usage patterns
3. Continuous performance testing and optimization
4. Investment in caching and database optimization
5. Implementation of auto-scaling policies

The projected 2.4x cost increase for 4.6x capacity improvement represents good value, with a cost per user decreasing from $2.18 to $1.14 per month.
