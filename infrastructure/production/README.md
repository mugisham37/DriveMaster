# Production Deployment Guide

This directory contains all production deployment configurations and procedures for the Adaptive Learning Platform.

## Overview

The production deployment follows a blue-green deployment strategy with comprehensive monitoring, security hardening, and operational procedures to ensure high availability and reliability.

## Architecture

### Production Environment Structure

```

│   ├── Kubernetes Cluster (Primary)
│   ├── Database (Primary)
│   └── Cache Layer (Primary)
├── Green Environment (Standby)

└── Backup Systems
```

### Key Components

1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capability
2. **Multi-Region Setup**: Primary region with disaster recovery region
3. **Auto-scaling**: Horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
4. **Security Hardening**: Network policies, RBAC, secrets management, and compliance controls
5. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Metrics, logs, traces, and alerting across all components

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.28+)
- Helm 3.x
- kubectl configured for production cluster
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment
- Proper RBAC permissions

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup production environment
./scripts/setup-production.sh

# 2. Deploy infrastructure components
./scripts/deploy-infrastructure.sh

# 3. Deploy application services
./scripts/deploy-services.sh

# 4. Verify deployment
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh

# 5. Switch traffic (blue-green)
./scripts/switch-traffic.sh
```

## Security

### Security Measures Implemented

- **Network Security**: Network policies, service mesh with mTLS
- **Identity & Access**: RBAC, service accounts, OAuth 2.0/OIDC
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secrets management
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliance, audit logging, data retention policies
- **Vulnerability Management**: Container scanning, dependency scanning

### Security Checklist

- [ ] All secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault or cloud-native secret manager
- [ ] Network policies configured for all namespaces
- [ ] RBAC policies implemented with least privilege principle
- [ ] Container images scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] TLS certificates configured and auto-renewed
- [ ] Audit logging enabled for all components
- [ ] Backup encryption verified
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures tested

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Monitoring Stack

- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Tracing**: Jaeger with OpenTelemetry
- **Alerting**: AlertManager + PagerDuty/Slack integration
- **Uptime Monitoring**: External monitoring with Pingdom/DataDog

### Key Metrics Monitored

- Application performance (latency, throughput, error rates)
- Infrastructure health (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Business metrics (user engagement, learning effectiveness)
- Security events (failed logins, suspicious activity)

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Operations

1. **Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring with manual verification
2. **Performance Review**: Daily performance metrics review
3. **Security Monitoring**: Security event review and incident response
4. **Backup Verification**: Automated backup success verification

### Weekly Operations

1. **Capacity Planning**: Resource utilization analysis and scaling decisions
2. **Security Updates**: Security patch review and deployment
3. **Performance Optimization**: Performance bottleneck analysis
4. **Disaster Recovery Testing**: DR procedure validation

### Monthly Operations

1. **Full System Backup**: Complete system backup and restore testing
2. **Security Audit**: Comprehensive security posture review
3. **Compliance Review**: GDPR and other compliance requirement verification
4. **Cost Optimization**: Resource usage and cost analysis

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime

### DR Procedures

1. **Automated Failover**: Automatic failover to secondary region
2. **Manual Failover**: Step-by-step manual failover procedures
3. **Data Recovery**: Database and file system recovery procedures
4. **Service Restoration**: Application service restoration procedures

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

- Data processing lawfulness documentation
- User consent management system
- Data subject rights implementation (access, rectification, erasure)
- Data breach notification procedures
- Privacy impact assessments

### Security Compliance

- SOC 2 Type II compliance preparation
- ISO 27001 security controls implementation
- Regular penetration testing
- Vulnerability management program

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Escalation Procedures

1. **Level 1**: Automated monitoring and basic troubleshooting
2. **Level 2**: On-call engineer response for critical issues
3. **Level 3**: Senior engineer and architect involvement
4. **Level 4**: Vendor support and external expert consultation
