# Security and Compliance Review

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security and compliance review for the Adaptive Learning Platform production deployment. It covers security controls, compliance requirements, and ongoing security practices.

## Security Architecture Review

### Network Security

#### Network Segmentation

- ✅ **Kubernetes Network Policies**: Implemented default-deny policies with explicit allow rules
- ✅ **Service Mesh Security**: Istio mTLS enabled for all service-to-service communication
- ✅ **Ingress Security**: Kong API Gateway with rate limiting and DDoS protection
- ✅ **VPC Isolation**: Production workloads isolated in dedicated VPC

#### Firewall Rules

```yaml
# Production firewall configuration
Ingress Rules:
  - Port 443 (HTTPS): Internet → Load Balancer
  - Port 80 (HTTP): Internet → Load Balancer (redirect to 443)
  - Port 22 (SSH): Bastion Host → Worker Nodes (restricted IPs)
  - Port 6443 (K8s API): Admin IPs → Control Plane

Egress Rules:
  - Port 443 (HTTPS): Services → External APIs (OAuth, CDN)
  - Port 53 (DNS): All → DNS Servers
  - Port 5432 (PostgreSQL): Services → Database (internal only)
  - Port 6379 (Redis): Services → Cache (internal only)
```

### Identity and Access Management

#### Authentication

- ✅ **OAuth 2.0/OIDC**: Integrated with Auth0 for user authentication
- ✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP-based MFA for all admin accounts
- ✅ **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation
- ✅ **Service Accounts**: Kubernetes service accounts with minimal permissions

#### Authorization

- ✅ **RBAC**: Role-based access control for all services
- ✅ **Attribute-Based Access**: Fine-grained permissions based on user attributes
- ✅ **API Gateway Authorization**: Kong validates JWT tokens and enforces rate limits
- ✅ **Database Access Control**: Row-level security for multi-tenant data

#### Secrets Management

- ✅ **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secrets management with rotation
- ✅ **Kubernetes Secrets**: Encrypted at rest with KMS
- ✅ **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets injected at runtime

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

```typescript
// Example security controls in application code
class SecurityMiddleware {
  // Input validation
  validateInput(input: any): boolean {
    return Joi.validate(input, this.schema);
  }

  // SQL injection prevention
  sanitizeQuery(query: string): string {
    return query.replace(/[';--]/g, "");
  }

  // XSS prevention
  sanitizeHTML(html: string): string {
    return DOMPurify.sanitize(html);
