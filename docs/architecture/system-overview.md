# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Adaptive Learning Platform is a cloud-native, microservices-based system designed to deliver personalized learning experiences at scale. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, design decisions, and technical implementation.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Architecture

- **Service Autonomy**: Each service owns its data and business logic
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- **Technology Diversity**: Services can use different technologies as appropriate
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed independently

### 2. Domain-Driven Design

- **Bounded Contexts**: Clear boundaries between business domains
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across teams
- **Aggregate Roots**: Consistent data models within domains
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Domain events for cross-service communication

### 3. Cloud-Native Principles

- **Containerization**: All services run in Docker containers
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling based on demand
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation

### 4. Security by Design

- **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust between components
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
