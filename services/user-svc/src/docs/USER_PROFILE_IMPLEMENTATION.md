## Database Schema

### Enhanced User Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  date_of_birth TIMESTAMP,
  cognitive_patterns JSONB,
  learning_preferences JSONB,
  total_xp INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  longest_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_active_at TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Cognitive Patterns Structure

```typescript
interface CognitivePatterns {
  learningStyle: 'visual' | 'auditory' | 'kinesthetic' | 'mixed'
  processingSpeed: number // 0.1 to 2.0
  attentionSpan: number // minutes
  preferredSessionLength: number // minutes
  optimalTimeOfDay: string[] // ['morning', 'afternoon', 'evening']
  difficultyPreference: 'gradual' | 'challenging' | 'mixed'
  feedbackPreference: 'immediate' | 'delayed' | 'summary'
}
```

### Learning Preferences Structure

```typescript
interface LearningPreferences {
  enableNotifications: boolean
  notificationFrequency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  studyReminders: boolean
  socialFeatures: boolean
  gamificationEnabled: boolean
  preferredLanguage: string
  accessibilityOptions: {
    highContrast: boolean
    largeText: boolean
    screenReader: boolean
    reducedMotion: boolean
  }
}
```

## Cognitive Pattern Analysis Algorithm

The system uses advanced behavioral analysis to detect cognitive patterns:

### 1. Processing Speed Analysis

- Analyzes response times across learning sessions
- Calculates normalized processing speed (faster = higher score)
- Formula: `Math.max(0.1, Math.min(2.0, 10000 / averageResponseTime))`

### 2. Learning Style Detection

- Based on device usage patterns and interaction preferences
- Mobile-heavy usage suggests kinesthetic learning
- Desktop-heavy usage suggests visual learning
- Mixed usage suggests adaptable learning style

### 3. Attention Span Calculation

- Analyzes session duration patterns
- Calculates average session length
- Adjusts for user performance during sessions

### 4. Optimal Time Analysis

- Tracks performance across different times of day
- Identifies peak performance periods
- Recommends optimal study times

### 5. Difficulty Preference Assessment

- Analyzes accuracy trends and user engagement
- High accuracy (>85%) suggests preference for challenging content
- Low accuracy (<65%) suggests need for gradual progression
- Moderate accuracy suggests mixed difficulty preference

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Comprehensive unit tests for cognitive pattern analysis logic
- Progress calculation validation
- Data validation testing
- Time analysis algorithms

### Integration Tests

- Full API endpoint testing
- Database integration validation
- Authentication and authorization testing
- GDPR compliance workflow testing

## Security Features

### Data Protection

- Encrypted storage of sensitive user data
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

### Privacy Compliance

- Automated data deletion workflows
- Complete data export functionality
- User consent management
- Audit logging for compliance

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations

- Composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- GIN indexes on JSONB columns for flexible queries
- Read replica support for analytics queries
- Connection pooling for high concurrency

### Caching Strategy

- Redis caching for frequently accessed user data
- Intelligent cache invalidation
- Session-based caching for user preferences

## Requirements Fulfilled
