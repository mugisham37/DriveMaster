# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration requirements for connecting the existing Next.js frontend application with the fully-functional Go-based user-service microservice. The user-service provides comprehensive user management, progress tracking, activity monitoring, and GDPR compliance features through both gRPC and HTTP endpoints. The frontend already has a complete auth-service integration with JWT token management, OAuth support, and session handling that will be leveraged for user-service authentication.

## Glossary

- **User_Service**: The Go microservice handling user profile, progress, and activity operations
- **Frontend_App**: The Next.js web application requiring user-service integration
- **Auth_Service**: The existing NestJS authentication microservice (already integrated)
- **JWT_Token**: JSON Web Token from auth-service used for user-service authentication
- **API_Gateway**: Next.js API routes serving as gateway between frontend and user-service
- **Progress_Tracker**: System for monitoring user learning progress and skill mastery
- **Activity_Monitor**: System for recording and analyzing user engagement patterns
- **GDPR_Manager**: System for handling data privacy and compliance requirements
- **Service_Client**: HTTP/gRPC client for communicating with user-service
- **Cache_Layer**: Multi-tiered caching system for optimizing data access
- **Circuit_Breaker**: Pattern for handling user-service failures gracefully

4. THE GDPR_Manager SHALL manage consent preferences and privacy settings
5. THE GDPR_Manager SHALL generate privacy reports and data usage summaries

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent caching for user-service data, so that the application performs optimally while maintaining data freshness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cache_Layer SHALL implement different cache strategies for different data types
2. THE Cache_Layer SHALL cache user profiles for 5 minutes and preferences for 15 minutes
3. WHEN data is mutated, THE Cache_Layer SHALL invalidate relevant cache entries immediately
4. THE Cache_Layer SHALL implement optimistic updates for better perceived performance
5. THE Cache_Layer SHALL provide cache warming for critical user data during app initialization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work gracefully when user-service is unavailable, so that my experience is not completely disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN User_Service is unavailable, THE Circuit_Breaker SHALL open and prevent cascading failures
2. THE Frontend_App SHALL display cached data with clear offline indicators
3. WHEN service recovers, THE Circuit_Breaker SHALL automatically resume normal operations
4. THE Frontend_App SHALL queue mutations for retry when User_Service becomes available
5. THE Frontend_App SHALL provide meaningful error messages with recovery suggestions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for user-service integration, so that all failure scenarios are handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_App SHALL classify errors into network, validation, authorization, and service error types
2. WHEN network errors occur, THE Frontend_App SHALL implement automatic retry with backoff
3. THE Frontend_App SHALL map User_Service error codes to user-friendly messages
4. THE Frontend_App SHALL log errors appropriately while sanitizing sensitive information
5. THE Frontend_App SHALL provide error recovery actions where applicable

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates for progress and activity data, so that I see immediate feedback on my learning actions.
