# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration requirements for connecting the existing Next.js frontend application with the fully-functional NestJS auth-service microservice. The auth-service is 85% complete and production-ready, providing comprehensive authentication features including OAuth support for five providers, JWT token management, MFA, audit logging, and advanced security features. The frontend currently has basic NextAuth.js setup (15-20% complete) that needs to be replaced with a direct integration to the auth-service backend.

## Glossary

- **Auth_Service**: The NestJS microservice handling all authentication operations
- **Frontend_App**: The Next.js web application requiring authentication integration
- **JWT_Token**: JSON Web Token used for authentication
- **Refresh_Token**: Long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens
- **OAuth_Provider**: External authentication providers (Google, Apple, Facebook, GitHub, Microsoft)
- **Session_Management**: Client-side authentication state management
- **API_Client**: HTTP client for communicating with auth-service
- **Token_Storage**: Secure storage mechanism for authentication tokens
- **Route_Protection**: Mechanism to protect routes requiring authentication
- **Circuit_Breaker**: Pattern for handling service failures gracefully

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using email/password or OAuth providers, so that I can securely access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid email and password credentials, THE Frontend_App SHALL authenticate with Auth_Service and establish a session
2. WHEN a user selects an OAuth provider, THE Frontend_App SHALL initiate OAuth flow through Auth_Service
3. WHEN OAuth authentication completes successfully, THE Frontend_App SHALL receive and store authentication tokens
4. WHEN authentication fails, THE Frontend_App SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
5. WHERE OAuth is selected, THE Frontend_App SHALL support all five providers configured in Auth_Service

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust HTTP client for auth-service communication, so that the frontend can reliably interact with authentication endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Client SHALL implement automatic token injection for authenticated requests
2. THE API_Client SHALL handle token refresh automatically when access tokens expire
3. WHEN Auth_Service is unavailable, THE API_Client SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern
4. THE API_Client SHALL include correlation IDs for distributed tracing
5. WHEN requests fail, THE API_Client SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't need to re-authenticate frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Token_Storage SHALL store refresh tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies
2. THE Token_Storage SHALL store access tokens in memory only for security
3. WHEN the browser is closed and reopened, THE Session_Management SHALL restore authentication state
4. THE Session_Management SHALL implement automatic token refresh before expiration
5. WHEN tokens are invalid or expired, THE Session_Management SHALL clear authentication state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want protected routes to require authentication, so that unauthorized access is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses a protected route, THE Route_Protection SHALL redirect to login page
2. THE Route_Protection SHALL preserve the intended destination URL for post-authentication redirect
3. WHEN authentication is verified, THE Route_Protection SHALL allow access to protected content
4. THE Route_Protection SHALL support role-based access control for mentor and insider features
5. WHERE authentication is required, THE Route_Protection SHALL show loading states during verification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want OAuth authentication to work seamlessly, so that I can use my preferred social login method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks an OAuth provider button, THE Frontend_App SHALL initiate OAuth flow with proper state management
2. THE Frontend_App SHALL handle OAuth callbacks and exchange authorization codes for tokens
3. WHEN OAuth authentication succeeds, THE Frontend_App SHALL create or link user accounts appropriately
4. THE Frontend_App SHALL support provider linking for authenticated users
5. WHEN OAuth errors occur, THE Frontend_App SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to work consistently across multiple browser tabs, so that my session state is synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication state changes in one tab, THE Session_Management SHALL broadcast changes to all open tabs
2. WHEN a user logs out in one tab, THE Session_Management SHALL log out all tabs immediately
3. THE Session_Management SHALL handle concurrent authentication attempts across tabs
4. WHEN tokens are refreshed in one tab, THE Session_Management SHALL update tokens in all tabs
5. THE Session_Management SHALL detect and handle session conflicts appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that authentication failures are handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur, THE Frontend_App SHALL display appropriate user messages
2. THE Frontend_App SHALL classify errors into network, validation, authentication, and server error types
3. WHEN Auth_Service returns error responses, THE Frontend_App SHALL map them to user-friendly messages
4. THE Frontend_App SHALL implement error recovery suggestions where applicable
5. WHEN critical errors occur, THE Frontend_App SHALL log them for debugging while sanitizing sensitive data

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want session timeout warnings, so that I can extend my session before it expires.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Session_Management SHALL track user activity using mouse, keyboard, and scroll events
2. WHEN session timeout approaches, THE Session_Management SHALL display warning dialog
3. THE Session_Management SHALL provide option to extend session through user activity
4. WHEN session expires, THE Session_Management SHALL redirect to login page gracefully
5. THE Session_Management SHALL respect configured session duration from Auth_Service

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile information to be accessible, so that I can view and manage my account details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticated, THE Frontend_App SHALL fetch and display user profile information
2. THE Frontend_App SHALL show linked OAuth providers with management options
3. THE Frontend_App SHALL display security information including active sessions
4. WHEN profile updates are made, THE Frontend_App SHALL synchronize changes with Auth_Service
5. THE Frontend_App SHALL support account linking and unlinking operations

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance optimization, so that authentication operations don't impact user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_App SHALL implement request batching for simultaneous authentication queries
2. THE Frontend_App SHALL cache non-sensitive authentication data with appropriate TTL
3. THE Frontend_App SHALL implement request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls
4. THE Frontend_App SHALL use connection pooling and keep-alive for HTTP requests
5. THE Frontend_App SHALL measure and optimize authentication flow performance metrics
