# Notification Service Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating the existing NestJS notification microservice with the Next.js frontend application. The integration will replace the current Rails-based notification system with a comprehensive, high-performance notification service that supports real-time delivery, advanced analytics, device token management, and sophisticated notification scheduling.

## Glossary

- **Notification_Service**: The existing NestJS microservice that handles all notification operations including push notifications, email notifications, in-app notifications, scheduling, and analytics
- **Frontend_Client**: The Next.js web application that will consume notification service APIs
- **Device_Token**: A unique identifier for a user's device used for push notification delivery
- **Notification_Template**: A reusable notification format with variable substitution capabilities
- **Real_Time_Channel**: WebSocket or SSE connection for immediate notification delivery
- **Analytics_Engine**: The notification service component that tracks delivery, engagement, and performance metrics
- **Circuit_Breaker**: A resilience pattern that prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to failing services
- **Token_Manager**: The existing authentication system that manages JWT tokens for service communication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Notification Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive, view, and manage notifications in real-time, so that I stay informed about important updates and can take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is sent from the Notification_Service, THE Frontend_Client SHALL receive the notification within 1 second via real-time channel
2. WHEN a user views their notification list, THE Frontend_Client SHALL display notifications with title, content, timestamp, read status, and action buttons
3. WHEN a user marks a notification as read, THE Frontend_Client SHALL update the notification status immediately and sync with Notification_Service
4. WHEN a user deletes a notification, THE Frontend_Client SHALL remove it from the UI immediately and send deletion request to Notification_Service
5. WHERE notification preferences are enabled, THE Frontend_Client SHALL filter notifications according to user preferences before display

### Requirement 2: Device Token Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive push notifications on my devices, so that I'm notified even when not actively using the web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the application, THE Frontend_Client SHALL request browser notification permission using native browser API
2. WHEN notification permission is granted, THE Frontend_Client SHALL register the device token with Notification_Service including platform and metadata
3. WHEN a user logs out, THE Frontend_Client SHALL deactivate the device token to prevent notifications to logged-out sessions
4. WHEN a user has multiple devices, THE Frontend_Client SHALL manage device tokens independently for each device
5. WHILE a user session is active, THE Frontend_Client SHALL refresh device tokens before expiration

### Requirement 3: Notification Templates and Scheduling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive personalized and scheduled notifications, so that the content is relevant and delivered at appropriate times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Frontend_Client sends a notification request, THE Frontend_Client SHALL support template-based notifications with variable substitution
2. WHEN scheduling a notification, THE Frontend_Client SHALL validate the scheduled time and send scheduling request to Notification_Service
3. WHEN a scheduled notification is created, THE Frontend_Client SHALL display the scheduled notification in the user's scheduled notifications list
4. WHEN a user cancels a scheduled notification, THE Frontend_Client SHALL send cancellation request to Notification_Service immediately
5. WHERE template rendering is required, THE Frontend_Client SHALL request template rendering from Notification_Service with user-specific data

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications instantly without refreshing the page, so that I can respond to time-sensitive information immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads, THE Frontend_Client SHALL establish WebSocket connection to Notification_Service for real-time updates
2. WHEN WebSocket connection fails, THE Frontend_Client SHALL fallback to Server-Sent Events or polling mechanism
3. WHEN a real-time notification arrives, THE Frontend_Client SHALL display toast notification and update notification count badge
4. WHEN connection is lost, THE Frontend_Client SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
5. WHILE offline, THE Frontend_Client SHALL queue notification actions and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 5: Analytics and Engagement Tracking

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track notification performance and user engagement, so that I can optimize notification effectiveness and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is delivered, THE Frontend_Client SHALL track delivery event with Notification_Service Analytics_Engine
2. WHEN a user opens a notification, THE Frontend_Client SHALL track open event with timestamp and user context
3. WHEN a user clicks a notification action, THE Frontend_Client SHALL track click event with action type and outcome
4. WHEN requesting analytics data, THE Frontend_Client SHALL support date range filtering and metric aggregation
5. WHERE A/B testing is active, THE Frontend_Client SHALL track variant assignment and performance metrics

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification system to work reliably even when there are network issues or service problems, so that I don't miss important notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Notification_Service is unavailable, THE Frontend_Client SHALL activate Circuit_Breaker and display cached notifications
2. WHEN network requests fail, THE Frontend_Client SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire, THE Frontend_Client SHALL refresh tokens automatically using Token_Manager
4. IF notification delivery fails, THEN THE Frontend_Client SHALL queue the notification for retry when service recovers
5. WHERE service degradation occurs, THE Frontend_Client SHALL provide graceful fallback functionality with user notification

### Requirement 7: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification system to be fast and responsive, so that I can quickly access and manage my notifications without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading notifications, THE Frontend_Client SHALL display cached notifications immediately while fetching updates
2. WHEN notification data is fetched, THE Frontend_Client SHALL cache results with appropriate TTL based on data type
3. WHEN user performs actions, THE Frontend_Client SHALL implement optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
4. WHEN pagination is required, THE Frontend_Client SHALL implement virtual scrolling for lists exceeding 100 notifications
5. WHERE real-time updates occur, THE Frontend_Client SHALL update cache and UI without full page refresh

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my notification data to be secure and private, so that sensitive information is protected and only accessible to authorized parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests, THE Frontend_Client SHALL include valid JWT tokens from Token_Manager for authentication
2. WHEN handling notification content, THE Frontend_Client SHALL sanitize and validate all data to prevent XSS attacks
3. WHEN storing notification data locally, THE Frontend_Client SHALL encrypt sensitive information using browser crypto APIs
