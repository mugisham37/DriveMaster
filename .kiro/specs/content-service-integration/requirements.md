# Content Service Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating the existing content-service backend microservice with the Next.js frontend application. The content-service provides comprehensive content management capabilities including CRUD operations, media handling, workflow management, search functionality, and bulk operations. The integration must establish robust, high-performance communication between the frontend and backend while following existing architectural patterns.

## Glossary

- **Content_Service**: The NestJS backend microservice that manages content items, media assets, workflows, and search functionality
- **Frontend_Application**: The Next.js web application that provides the user interface
- **ContentServiceClient**: The TypeScript client class that will handle all communication with the content-service
- **Content_Item**: A content entity managed by the content-service (questions, exercises, lessons, etc.)
- **Media_Asset**: Files (images, videos, documents) associated with content items
- **Workflow_State**: The approval status of content (draft, review, approved, published, archived)
- **Search_Index**: Elasticsearch-powered search functionality for content discovery
- **Bulk_Operation**: Operations that process multiple content items simultaneously
- **JWT_Token**: JSON Web Token used for authentication between services

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Content Management Integration

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to create, read, update, and delete content items through the web interface, so that I can manage educational content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new content item, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a POST request to `/content/items` with validated data
2. WHEN a user requests content items, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a GET request to `/content/items` with pagination and filtering parameters
3. WHEN a user updates a content item, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a PUT request to `/content/items/{id}` with the updated data
4. WHEN a user deletes a content item, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a DELETE request to `/content/items/{id}` and handle soft deletion
5. WHERE content retrieval fails, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2: Authentication and Authorization Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all content-service requests to be properly authenticated and authorized, so that only authorized users can access and modify content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL attach JWT tokens to all requests using existing authentication mechanisms
2. WHEN a JWT token expires, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL automatically refresh the token using existing token management
3. WHEN authentication fails, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL redirect users to the login page
4. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL respect role-based permissions for content operations
5. WHERE token refresh fails, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL clear local authentication state

### Requirement 3: Media Asset Management Integration

**User Story:** As a content author, I want to upload, manage, and retrieve media assets for my content, so that I can create rich multimedia educational materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a media file, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a multipart/form-data POST request to `/content/items/{id}/media`
2. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL support chunked uploads for large media files with progress tracking
3. WHEN a user requests media assets, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL retrieve signed URLs from `/content/media/{id}/signed-url`
4. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL implement client-side image optimization before upload
5. WHERE media upload fails, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL provide resume capability for interrupted uploads

### Requirement 4: Search and Discovery Integration

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to search for content using keywords and filters, so that I can quickly find relevant educational materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send requests to `/search` with debounced input
2. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions using `/search/suggestions` endpoint
3. WHEN a user applies search filters, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send POST requests to `/search/faceted`
4. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL cache search results for 5 minutes to improve performance
5. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL provide personalized recommendations using `/search/recommendations/personalized`

### Requirement 5: Workflow Management Integration

**User Story:** As a content reviewer, I want to manage content approval workflows through the interface, so that I can ensure content quality before publication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a content author submits content for review, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a POST request to `/content/items/{id}/submit-for-review`
2. WHEN a reviewer approves or rejects content, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a POST request to `/content/items/{id}/review`
3. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL retrieve workflow history using `/content/items/{id}/workflow-history`
4. WHEN content is published, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a POST request to `/content/items/{id}/publish`
5. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL support bulk workflow operations using `/content/items/bulk-workflow`

### Requirement 6: Performance and Caching Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the content interface to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL implement SWR caching for frequently accessed content with 10-minute TTL
2. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL use request deduplication to prevent duplicate API calls
3. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL implement optimistic updates for content modifications
4. WHERE network requests fail, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL serve stale cached data when available
5. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL prefetch related content during idle time

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear error messages and have the system recover gracefully from failures, so that I can understand issues and continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern with 5-failure threshold
2. WHEN API requests fail, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL retry failed requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHERE content-service is unavailable, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL show cached content with offline indicators
5. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL log detailed error information for debugging while showing simplified messages to users

### Requirement 8: Bulk Operations Integration

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to perform bulk operations on multiple content items, so that I can efficiently manage large amounts of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates bulk import, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL send a POST request to `/content/bulk/import` with progress tracking
2. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL support CSV parsing using `/content/bulk/import/csv` for preview before import
3. WHEN a user requests bulk export, THE ContentServiceClient SHALL initiate export jobs using `/content/bulk/export`
4. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL poll export job status using `/content/bulk/export/{jobId}` until completion
5. THE ContentServiceClient SHALL support batch operations using `/content/bulk/batch-operation` with progress indicators

### Requirement 9: Real-time Updates Integration

**User Story:** As a content collaborator, I want to see real-time updates when content changes, so that I can coordinate effectively with other team members.
