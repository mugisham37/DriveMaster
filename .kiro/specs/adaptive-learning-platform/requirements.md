# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Adaptive Learning Platform is a production-ready, scalable mobile-first system designed for driving test preparation across multiple jurisdictions. The platform combines sophisticated machine learning algorithms including Spaced Repetition System (SRS), Item Response Theory (IRT), Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), contextual bandits, and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to deliver personalized learning experiences. The system architecture follows microservices patterns with Flutter mobile apps, Next.js web applications, and a distributed backend using Go, Python, and NestJS services communicating via gRPC and Kafka.
