# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Adaptive Learning Platform is a production-ready, scalable mobile-first system for driving test preparation that serves thousands of concurrent users. The platform combines sophisticated machine learning algorithms (Spaced Repetition System, Item Response Theory, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, contextual bandits, and Deep Knowledge Tracing) to deliver personalized learning experiences across Flutter mobile and Next.js web applications, supported by a microservices backend architecture.
