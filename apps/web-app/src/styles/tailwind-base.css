/* Tailwind CSS Base Configuration */
/* This file documents the Tailwind CSS setup and suppresses language server warnings */

/*
  The @apply directive is a Tailwind CSS feature that allows you to use utility classes
  within custom CSS. If you see warnings about "unknown at rule @apply", these are
  expected and can be safely ignored.
  
  To suppress these warnings in VS Code:
  1. Install the "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" extension
  2. The .vscode/settings.json file in this project configures CSS validation
