        <h3>
          Hi there!
          <span className="waving-hand">üëã</span>
          I&apos;m Jeremy, and I&apos;ve helped over
          <div className="inline rough-highlight">two million people</div>
          {' '}level up their coding skills.
        </h3>
        
        <p>But over the last few years, I&apos;ve seen a really worrying trend...</p>
        
        <p>
          More and more people are trying to learn to code (ü•≥) but they seem to be
          <strong> struggling more than ever (üò¢).</strong>
          {' '}And they&apos;re struggling with things that should be pretty straightforward once you&apos;ve been learning for a while.
          People just don&apos;t seem to be getting the fundamentals.
        </p>

        <p>So I started reading around to see if I could work out what was going on, and found a crazy statistic.</p>
        
        <h3>
          <span className="inline rough-highlight">96% of people who try to learn to code give up</span>
          {' '}ü§Ø
        </h3>

        <p>How could it be that so many people were trying to learn to code, but so few were actually succeeding?</p>
        <p>I went investigating‚Ä¶ üïµÔ∏è</p>
        
        <p>
          I watched the
          <strong> most popular YouTube videos (ü•±),</strong>
          {' '}tried the &quot;best&quot;
          <strong> online courses (üòê),</strong>
          {' '}and even paid my friends to try to learn so I could see what happened (a mix of üò≠üò†ü§¨üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).
        </p>

        <p>I dug into formal research, spoke to my friends in education, and pretty quickly came to a simple conclusion...</p>

        <h3>
          <span className="inline rough-highlight">The way people are being taught to code is causing them to fail!</span>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          I started coding when I was 8.
          Back then, YouTube didn&apos;t exist. There weren&apos;t any &quot;learn to code&quot; websites. I didn&apos;t even have the internet.
          There was basically only one way to learn.
          <strong> Make stuff. Lots of stuff!</strong>

        {/* Continue with rest of the content... */}
        <p className="mt-16">
          And make stuff I did! I started making games and then graduated to making little bots to play against. And as I grew older I made websites for me and my friends, and
          <span className="sm:hidden inline"> eventually for customers.</span>

        <p>I created, I played, I experimented. I had fun!</p>
        
        <p>
          And through this, I got really good.
          <strong> I learned the coder mindset,</strong>
          {' '}and I laid the foundations that I&apos;ve built my whole career on.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong className="rough-highlight">But that&apos;s not how these modern courses teach.</strong>
          {' '}Giving you a space to practice and play and experiment is hard.
          It&apos;s much easier to just give you a video to watch, a quiz to take, and a certificate to print out.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          But you won&apos;t learn that way.
          You&apos;ll be
          <strong> bored, frustrated,</strong>
          {' '}and like most other people, you&apos;ll
          <strong> probably quit üòûüò°</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>
          <span className="rough-highlight">If you want to get good, master the basics</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          The best coders
          <strong> are not</strong>
          {' '}the ones who know the most.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The best coders are the ones who have
          <strong className="rough-highlight"> gained a total mastery of the basics.</strong>
          {' '}Once you&apos;ve got the basics down, everything will become easy.
          You can go and learn whatever you want or need.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          And the way to master the basics? Practice, practice, practice.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Take on different challenges. Solve different problems. And have fun learning your craft!

          <span className="rough-highlight">So that&apos;s what we&apos;re doing...</span>
        </h3>

        <p>
          For the last year, we&apos;ve been building a new type of course.
          It&apos;s designed for
          <strong> total beginners</strong>
          {' '}and it&apos;s entirely focused on
          <strong> learning by doing.</strong>
          {' '}You&apos;ll be coding from day one, and
          <strong className="font-semibold rough-highlight"> you&apos;ll be coding a lot.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          And once (just once!) we&apos;re going to run it as an
          <strong> interactive bootcamp,</strong>
          {' '}where
          <strong> I&apos;ll be there to guide you.</strong>
          {' '}I&apos;ll be there to explore ideas with you, help you if you get stuck, and have fun with you! ‚ú®
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For 3 months, I&apos;ll teach you the fundamentals of programming and
          <strong> how to think like a coder.</strong>
          {' '}Then for those who want to go into web development, I&apos;ll spend another 3 months teaching you how to build beautiful, interactive websites.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If that sounds exciting, then
          <strong> I&apos;d love for you to join us! üíô</strong>
